'use client';

with this we tell the nextjs compiler to include this file or component in our javascript bundle and
that means if this component is dependent on other components, those components will automatically become
client components and will be included in our javascript bundle,

To make our application more faster and SEO friendly, we want to render our components on server as much as possible and
use client components only when necessary.
